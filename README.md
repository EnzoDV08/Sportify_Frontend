## How To Install

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

You can either:
- **Option A:** Click "Code" on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/EnzoDV08/Sportify_Frontend.git), then choose "Open with GitHub Desktop"
- **Option B:** Use the terminal to clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EnzoDV08/Sportify_Frontend.git
```

### Step 2: Open the Project Directory

If using the terminal:
```bash
cd Sportify_Frontend
```
If using GitHub Desktop, the folder should be opened automatically in your editor after cloning.

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory. Below is an example template‚Äî**do not use the actual keys from our deployment**:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=your_backend_url_here
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id_here
VITE_UNSPLASH_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key_here
```

If you're running the backend locally, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000`. Otherwise, use your own Render or similar deployment URL.

### Step 5: Running Locally

```bash
cd Sportify
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

## The Idea

Sportify was built to bridge the gap between everyday sports enthusiasts and local event organizers. With a mission to make sports more accessible, interactive, and community-driven, Sportify empowers users to create, discover, and join sporting events in their area. Whether you're an individual looking to stay active, an organization hosting tryouts, or a team wanting to grow its audience‚ÄîSportify provides a digital space to connect, compete, and celebrate shared passions. The platform emphasizes inclusivity, security through 2FA, and real-time collaboration through features like invites, join approvals, and user profiles, making sports engagement easier and more exciting for everyone.

---

## Development Process

### Highlights
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Modular Architecture:** Sportify was developed with a clear separation of concerns using React and Vite, with a structured directory for pages, components, services, models, and styles.
- üîê **Authentication System:** Integrated both email/password and Google OAuth sign-in methods, supported by two-factor authentication using Google Authenticator.
- üåç **Interactive Maps & Geolocation:** Used Google Maps API and IP-based geolocation to help users discover nearby events visually and contextually.
- üñºÔ∏è **Media Integration:** Integrated the Unsplash API to allow dynamic image selection for event banners, improving UX without hosting overhead.
- ‚ö° **Real-Time UI:** Events, invites, join statuses, and user interactions are updated live through effective state management and conditional rendering.

### Challenges
- üìâ **Outdated ERD:** Early misalignment between our Entity Relationship Diagram and the live database caused confusion during model setup and API development.
- üìç **Inaccurate Location Filtering:** The Nearby Events feature initially returned incorrect results due to mismatches between user geolocation and event location strings.
- üîê **2FA QR Code Issues:** The QR code for enabling two-step authentication was not displaying due to incorrect API key routing and frontend state handling.
- üñºÔ∏è **Profile Picture Bugs:** Profile images for users and participants were not rendering reliably because of missing fallback handling and path mismatches.
- üîÑ **Complex Role Management:** Handling multiple user types‚Äîregular users, event creators, organizations, and admins‚Äîled to challenges in permission-based UI rendering and route protection.
- üåê **Cross-Origin Deployment:** We encountered issues syncing frontend (Netlify) and backend (Render) deployments, which required custom CORS configuration and environment tuning.
- üìã **Form Complexity & Validation:** Creating highly dynamic forms (e.g., event creation, profile edit, organization signup) demanded robust client-side and server-side validation.
- üé® **Styling Consistency:** Achieving design coherence using both TailwindCSS and DaisyUI required deliberate style overrides and reuse strategies.

## Future Implementations

- üí¨ **In-App Messaging:** A live chat system for users to communicate within events.
- üß† **Smart Recommendations:** Suggest events to users based on past activity, location, and interests.
- üóìÔ∏è **Calendar Sync:** Allow users to sync events to their personal calendars (Google, iCal, Outlook).
- üîî **Enhanced Notifications:** Add browser push notifications for real-time event updates and approvals.
- üì± **Mobile Optimization:** Further improve mobile responsiveness and test for multiple devices.
- üßæ **Event Analytics:** Provide hosts with stats on attendance, user engagement, and participation trends.
- üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë **Team Formation:** Allow users to form teams, register as a group, and track group performance.
- üèÜ **User-Created Achievements:** Users with event permissions can create and assign unique achievements to participants.
- üè¢ **Advanced Organization Tools:** Support organizations in managing large-scale event portfolios, with custom branding and admin tools.
- ‚≠ê **Reputation & Reviews:** Introduce a profile review system where participants can rate and leave feedback after events.
- üí≠ **Event Discussion Threads:** Enable comment-based chat on event pages for communication among participants.
- üìÖ **Poll-Based Schedule Changes:** Allow event creators to request date/time changes that participants can vote on through built-in polls.

The development process for Sportify focused on iteratively building a stable, scalable, and user-focused platform. Regular testing, peer reviews, and client feedback helped us fine-tune the experience while preparing the app for real-world deployment and long-term scalability.
